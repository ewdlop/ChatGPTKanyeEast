Alright, here's my pick:

### **"Oh, You Have ChatGPT Write That?"**  

*(Verse 1)*  
Sitting at the screen, fingers kinda still,  
Need a spark of genius, need a little thrill.  
Someone calls me out, yeah, they start to chat,  
“Oh, you have ChatGPT write that?”  

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
Well, maybe I do, maybe I don’t,  
But the rhythm’s alive, so I’ll take that throne.  

*(Chorus)*  
Oh, you have ChatGPT write that?  
Guess I’ll own it, yeah, tip my hat.  
From the beats to the rhymes, it’s a wild duet,  
Man and machine, we ain’t done yet.  

*(Verse 2)*  
It’s not a ghost, it’s not a cheat,  
It’s collaboration with a digital beat.  
Words come alive, they twist and they play,  
Who cares who wrote it, if it slaps today?  

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
I feed it the thoughts, it sparks the lines,  
Together we’re cookin’ in record time.  

*(Chorus)*  
Oh, you have ChatGPT write that?  
Guess I’ll own it, yeah, tip my hat.  
From the beats to the rhymes, it’s a wild duet,  
Man and machine, we ain’t done yet.  

*(Bridge)*  
Call it lazy, call it strange,  
But the future’s here, and we’re turning the page.  
Every word, every note, it’s a jam-packed vibe,  
A little AI can’t kill my pride.  

*(Chorus)*  
Oh, you have ChatGPT write that?  
Guess I’ll own it, yeah, tip my hat.  
From the beats to the rhymes, it’s a wild duet,  
Man and machine, we ain’t done yet.  

*(Outro)*  
So laugh if you want, but here’s the deal,  
Creativity’s fire, and it’s all too real.  
“Oh, you have ChatGPT write that?” they say,  
Well, it’s our song now—play it anyway!
